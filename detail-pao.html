						Work done for my school DTP association.

					<br/>
					<p class="small-content">
						During my first year of engineering school, i was a member of the school DTP association. <br/>
						It was a really thrilling experience, which allowed me to acquire knowledge about publication, DTP related softwares such as InDesign and Photoshop, but above all learn about all the printing peculiarities for instance color models, resolutions etc.
						I had therefore the opportunity to be a member of the team creating the official 2015 students school presentation leaflet (called 'Alpha leaflet'), distributed to all students willing to join our school in 2016.
						I also won the  '2015 Alpha contest', a yearly design competition. Competitors had to create a design for the 2015 alpha leaflet cover. The winner's creation was printed as the cover of the leaflet.
						<br/><br/>
						In addition, during my term in this association, i had to create several posters for student events and logos for students associations.
